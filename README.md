# Secret Santa App
This web application is designed to facilitate the organization of Secret Santa events. Users can create a group, add as many participants as they like and specify a budget cap. The program then assigns each participant a unique giftee (the person for whom they purchase a gift). Before a participant is able to view their giftee, they must detail the type of gift they themselves would like to receive. As such, once everyone has inputed their preferences, participants are able to use the application to see who their giftee is and what they would like to receive.
