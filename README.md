# Secret Santa App
This web application is designed to facilitate the organization of Secret Santa events. Users can create a group, add as many participants as they'd like, and specify a budget cap. The program then assigns each participant a unique giftee. Before a participant is able to view their giftee, they are required to detail the type of gift they themselves would like to receive. As such, once everyone has inputed their preferences, participants are able to use the application to see who they are gifting to alongside a description of what their giftee would like to receive.
